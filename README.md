## Setup local development

To run the application, clone this repository to your local machine.

It requires the JDK installed on your local machine, this application uses JDK 8, but any higher version should be compatible.
Please see the proper [Java download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) for the correct installation of JDK.

---

With an IDE like Eclipse you can run the StugaApplication.java
In this case, Eclipse will compile and run the code for you.

to do this manually, after installing a JDK you can open the command prompt to compile and run the application.

- Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the repository. this can be for example C:\users\\{yourusername}\Stuga

  and further navigate to the following directory
  \src\main\java\nl\createment\stuga

- Type 'javac StugaApplication.java' and press enter to compile the code. The command prompt will take you to the next line

- Now, type ' java StugaApplication ' to run your program.

after running the code, you will see the startup process in your console. This runs the web application on your local machine.

When this is finished you will be able to open any browser and go to 'localhost:8080' to see and use the application.
